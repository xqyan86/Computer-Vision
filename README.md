# Computer-Vision
Knowledge Summary of Computer Vision

I contacted computer vision from 10 years ago when I used MATLAB. In my former company, I have been worked with machine vision. At that time, I learned HALCON to develop vision programs. I also learned opencv2 for a short time. 

In this folder, I will try to summarize the points on machine vision and computer vision, and may includes some projects of deep learning.
