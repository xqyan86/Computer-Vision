# Computer-Vision
Knowledge Summary of Computer Vision

I have beening working in computer vision for 10 years. I used MATLAB at the begining, then learned HALCON to develop programs. I learned opencv2 for a short time. So it's time to pick opencv up using python. 

In this folder, I will try to summarize the points on computer vision, and may includes some projects of deep learning.
